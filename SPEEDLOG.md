# SPEEDLOG

June 15, 2019 (Spinup): 100

July 12, 2019 (Initial theming): 99
First drop in pagespeed is due to new font loading using web-font-loader plugin. See 
about async options and/or self-hosted.

July 15, 2019 (Header theming): 98-100 on three audit runs
Averages out to 98, so didn't lose anything. I think the point difference can be chalked up to throttling speed/internet differences.

Accessibility: 98â€”Tooltip has invalid aria-describedby. Not sure how to fix as this is added by the tooltip script.
